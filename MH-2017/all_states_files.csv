New fodder technology: To overcome the shortage of animal feed, Agriculture Science Center, Banka, on the technology level of urea treated animal feed Planned to be removed. Here, special preparations are underway. The wood and straw as soon Ksianon treated animal feed information to be provided. In view of this, there is a shortage of animal feed in the form of this, it is needed here and in this month, from 27th May, the animal husbandry will be trained in KVK for urea treated animal feed. The scientists said that the treated straw can be fed to the animals who make chewing more than six months of age. It is fertile and protein rich for animals. The option of treated straw will reduce the consumption of grain by 25 to 30 percent. What's urea treated bait: urea solution by making straw, wheat etc. Jidkav storage of dry fodder is upto the solution. The storage house should not be open during storage. Keep it off from the plastic. Stockman wood and wheat straw as the macro you want to be treated in a less than 10 quintals of straw treatment is accurate. 40 quinine urea and 400 liters of water is required for 10 quintal straw. At the same time, 4 kg urea is dissolved in 40 liters of water for treatment in low scale. Training to make animal husbandry in KVK from 27th May. Take the method of treatment 100 kg of straw and spread it on cement or pucca floor, spread the straw in the ground so that the thickness of the plate is about 3 to 4 inches above 40 liters of solution Sprinkle this spreading straw with Hazare, then roll the straw well with the feet or jump and press it. Over 100 grams of straw on top of the straw and again 4 kg of urea Dissolved in 40 liters of water and sprayed again pressed with the same process and the volume of their Hsiab whether it can stock. Now cover the treated straw with plastic sheets and put soil on the edges touching it in the ground so that if the subsequent gas does not get out of the plastic sheet, do not get the dough, put a little dry straw on top of it, dry dry soil or straw on it Leap smooth mud or dung can put up to three weeks and left Ucharit feed urea treated straw yellow color is dark brown. Thus treated hedge is prepared as a food for livestock. Precautions to be done on a stack of straw, spray the urea solution uniformly and mix well, Urea should never try to feed the animal directly, it can be poison for the animal. At the time of treatment of straw, the prepared solution of urea should be kept out of the animals. The heat treatments in a pile of straw in 21 days and 28 days after the opening of the winter, before feeding the straw spread in the open air for about 10 minutes, the gas evaporates Jasise said. At the beginning, let the treated straw be treated to the animal, gradually eating habit after eating habit. Keep children away from the heaps of healing so that their\r\nThere is no adverse effect on health. It is said that the specially treated animal feed will be a boon for animal husbandry. This will reduce the cost of animal husbandry by 30 to 40 percent. This type of fodder is quite well-educated despite having intensive proteins and calcium. Due to its use, milk production will also increase. Dr. Dharmendra Kumar,""]",JABALPUR,3,Government Schemes,about farmer gehu i information know puwal to want,MADHYA PRADESH
