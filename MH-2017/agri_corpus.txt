Fluid discharge from the bullock's eye 
Fluid is discharging from the bullock's eye.
What should be done?
There are many causes of fluid discharge from an animal's eye; out of those, following are the main causes.
1. The eyeball or the inner side of the eyelid gets hit and this causes swelling or a wound.
2. Infection caused by germs.
3. Having cancer of the eyelid or the eyeball.
The remedy depends on which of the above have caused the fluid discharge.
In case of cause 1 and 2, a cream that can be applied in the eye - neomycin cream or any other cream should be applied everyday, after cleaning the eye. 
In case of eye cancer, growth is seen on the eyelid or on the eyeball.
In such case, the only remedy is to surgically remove the growth by veterinary surgeons.

National Sample Survey
According to a National Sample Survey (NSS), the monthly per capita consumption of cereals in India has declined from 14 kg to 12 kg in rural areas over the period 1987.
This is despite the fact that at constant prices the monthly per capita consumer expenditure (MPCE) has risen by 6 percent in rural areas and by 13 percent in urban areas over the same period..
The all-India MPCE during 1997 was Rs. 459, while expenditure on food was Rs. 255 and expenditure on non-food items was Rs. 204.
In rural areas, the MPCE was Rs. 395, while expenditure on food items was Rs. 232 and expenditure on non-food items was Rs. 163 while in urban areas, the MPCE was Rs. 645, while expenditure on food items was Rs. 320 and expenditure on non-food items was Rs. 325.
The urban-rural disparity in MPCE was only 12 percent in Punjab but 100 percent in Maharashtra.
The average household size in the country was 5.0 in rural areas and 4.6 in urban areas in 1997.
NNMB Study
According to a survey conducted by National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) in 10 states which are A.P. and Gujarat and Karnataka and Kerala and M.P. and Maharashtra and Orissa and T.N. and W.B. and U.P. , the consumption was equal to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) level though it was showing a failing tendency with years.
The intake of pulses and legumes has remained lower than RDA level.
The average intake of leafy vegetables, an inexpensive source of vitamins and minerals, was only one-third of RDA level, while the consumption of other vegetables was marginally lower than RDA levels.
The consumption of fruits has risen slightly during 1990-1997.
The daily intake of milk and milk products, visible fat, and sugar and jaggery was only half, half, and two-thirds of RDA levels respectively in 1997.
The intake of proteins was comparable to RDA but has fallen marginally since 1990.
In terms of calorific value of food, the intake is failing since 1982 and is below RDA.
The intake of iron is apparently normal but the bio-availability of iron in Indian diet is poor at 3 percent.
The intake of vitamin A varies from 30 to 60 percent of RDA in diets in different regions.
The intake of riboflavin is about two-thirds of RDA level.
The intake of vitamin C is satisfactory.

Search for Agricultural Policy and Programmes
Institute of Development Studies at Jaipur has taken up a comprehensive all-India research project 'Equity-driven trade and marketing policy strategies for improved performance of Indian Agriculture' on agricultural reforms with financial support from the Australian government.
The project will work out a package of agricultural policies and programmesto improve the efficient utilization of resourcesand food security for masses and reduction in regional disparities.
The non-availability of more land is a major constraint in the growth of agriculture.
There is a need to increase the cropping intensity from 134 to 140 percent and the value of output from Rs. 15326 to Rs. 17688 per hectare and the gross cropped area from 190 to 199 million hectares and fertilizer consumption from 14 to 20 million tonnes.
There is no scope for expansion in the net sown area.
There is a need to give more attention to high growth areas like animal husbandry and dairy and fishery and also improve and expand and upgrade the marketing and storage and distribution infrastructure and set up facilities for packaging and grading and certification of agricultural commodities.
Central Plan Outlay
The allocation for agriculture was hiked by 58 percent to Rs. 2854 crores from Rs. 1807 crores by enhancing outlays on irrigation and agricultural credit in the budget.
The outlay on watershed development programmes was raised from Rs. 517 crores in 1997 to Rs. 677 crores in 1998.
All the watershed development programmes implemented by different ministries were proposed to be unified to make a better utilization of funds.
The allocation for accelerated irrigation programme was enhanced by Rs. 200 crores.
the share capital of NABARD was raised from Rs. 1500 crores to 2000 crores with Rs. 100 crores contributed by the exchequer and Rs. 400 crores contributed by the RBI, in 1998-99.
This was done to enable NABARD to increase its leverage.
This was done to enable NABARD to obtain additional resources from the market to meet its credit needs for agriculture.
A sum of Rs. 264 crores was also provided for rehabilitation and recapitalisation of regional rural banks.
A provision of Rs. 60 crores was made for technology mission on cotton.
A provision of Rs. 100 crores was made for experimental crop insurance scheme.
A provision of Rs. 500 crores was made for rural infrastructure development fund of NABARD.
the subsidy on potassium and phosphatic fertilizers was increased in the budget.
the import duty on biopesticides was reduced in the budget.
excise duty on jute products was cut in the budget.
100 percent tax-exemption on biopesticide manufacturing units was granted In the budget.
duty on diesel-generating sets of power upto 10 HP was reduced in the budget.
the manufacture of agricultural implements in the small scale sector was dereserved in the budget to improve their quality.
During 1996-97, the share of private investment however rose from 63 percent to 81 percent.
This rise is attributed mostly to better terms of trade offered by the government to agriculture vis-a-vis industry.
The fall in public sector investment is attributed to increase in current expenditure to meet higher subsidies on food, fertilisers, electricity, irrigation, credit and other farm inputs.
In recent years public expenditure on maintenance of existing irrigation projects has gone up and investment on new projects has fallen.
Many of the projects are still awaiting completion because of cost overruns and non-availability of necessary timely funds.
It was proposed to raise the investment in agriculture to 18 percent of the total plan outlay in the Eighth Plan.
The actual investment turned out to be 10 percent.
The government also announced a scheme to issue Kisan Credit Cards to farmers.
The farmers will be able to obtain loans from designated banks on the basis of their land holdings for the purchase of seeds and Fertilizers and pesticides and any other inputs under the scheme.
The scheme will be open for about 1 lakh farmer families.
The procedural details of the scheme were to be worked out and announced by NABARD after working out the modalities.
The necessary refinance to the commercial and other banks for the implementation of the scheme was to be provided by NABARD.
The ministry of agriculture is expected to have spent only 1974 crore rupees in 1998 out of the budgetary allocation of 2854 crore rupees in 1998.
The central plan outlay for agriculture and rural development was raised by 47 percent over the revised estimate of 1998 to 2897 crore rupees.
The lesser expenditure in 1998 is attributed to long delays in execution of work plans by states.
Ninth Plan Projections
The demand for foodgrains in India is expected to rise to 220 million tonnes by the end of the Ninth Plan according to an earlier estimate.
The demand for household consumption in India is expected to rise to 185 million tonnes by the end of the Ninth Plan according to an earlier estimate.
The demand for food processing industries in India is expected to rise to 27 million tonnes by the end of the Ninth Plan according to an earlier estimate.
The demand for export in India is expected to rise to 7 million tonnes by the end of the Ninth Plan according to an earlier estimate.
The area under foodgrains was raised to 120 million hectares to meet this demand besides affecting the usual increases in the yield through the use of better quality seeds and effective pest and disease control.
The demand for fruits was expected to go up to 50 million tonnes.
The demand for vegetables was expected to go up to 95 million tonnes.
The demand for edible oils was expected to go up to 10 million tonnes.
The demand for sugar was expected to go up to 7 million tonnes
The foodgrain and edible oil target is not expected to be achieved.
There was a significant shortfall in public sector investment in agriculture in the Eighth Plan according to the Planning Commission.
This shortfall should be reversed in the Ninth Plan.
The target for agricultural growth should be fixed taking into account the gap in the domestic availability and the demand for domestic consumption and exports
The output of agricultural and allied products should grow at 352 percent to meet the domestic needs and to take advantage of the world market in value terms.
The world market offers significant opportunity to earn foreign exchange through exports.
The annual growth rate should be 45 percent.
This calls for an investment of 268300 crore rupees in the Ninth Plan.
The investment in the Ninth Plan is higher than the investment in the Eighth Plan.

India Agriculture
Agriculture is art, science, and industry of managing the growth of plants and animals for human use.
In a broad sense, agriculture includes cultivation of the soil and growing and harvesting crops and breeding and raising livestock and dairying and forestry.
Regional and national agriculture are covered in more detail in individual continent, country, state, and Canadian province articles.
Modern agriculture depends heavily on engineering and technology and on the biological and physical sciences. 
each of Irrigation and drainage and conservation and sanitary engineering is important in successful farming.
Irrigation and drainage and conservation and sanitary engineering are some of the fields requiring the specialized knowledge of agricultural engineers.
Agricultural chemistry deals with other vital farming concerns, such as the application of fertilizer and insecticides and fungicides and soil makeup and analysis of agricultural products and nutritional needs of farm animals.
Plant breeding and genetics contribute immeasurably to farm productivity.
Genetics has also made a science of livestock breeding.
Hydroponics is a method of soilless gardening.
In this method, plants are grown in chemical nutrient solutions.
Hydroponics may help to meet the need for greater food production as the world's population increases.
The packing, processing, and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by science.
Methods of quick-freezing and dehydration have increased the markets for farm products.
Mechanization which is the outstanding characteristic of agriculture in late 19th and 20th century, has eased much of the backbreaking toil of the farmer.
More significantly, mechanization has enormously increased farm efficiency and productivity.
However, Animals including horses and oxen and llamas and alpacas and dogs are still used to cultivate fields, harvest crops, and transport farm products to markets in many parts of the world.
Airplanes and helicopters are employed in agriculture for seeding and spraying operations for insect and disease control.
Airplanes and helicopters are employed in agriculture for transporting perishable products and fighting forest fires.
Radio and television disseminate vital weather reports and other information such as market reports that concern farmers.
Computers have become an essential tool for farm management.

INDIAN AGRICULTURE 
India has made lot of progress in agriculture since independence in terms of growth in output, yields and area under many crops.
It has gone through a green revolution, a white revolution, a yellow revolution and a blue revolution.
Today, India is the largest producer of milk, fruits, cashewnuts, coconuts and tea in the world, the second largest producer of wheat, vegetables, sugar and fish and the third largest producer of tobacco and rice.
The per capita availability of foodgrains has risen in the country from 350 gm in 1951 to about 500 gm per day now, of milk from less than 125 gm to 210 gm per day and of eggs from 5 to 30 per annum despite the increase in population from 35 crores to 95 crores.
However, India would have been in an even better position now both in terms of agricultural output and economic development had our planners given the required importance to its development it deserved in the early years since independence.
Even today, the farmers in India are able to obtain only 15 per cent of their requirements of agricultural credit from banks.
The various state seed corporations are able to produce only 1 0 per cent of the seeds required by our farmers.
At present only 23-30 per cent of the farmers are able to derive any benefits of extension services provided by various government agencies and every year about 20 per cent of the crop is lost due to mishandling, spillage, floods, droughts and pests and diseases.
In fruits and vegetables the loss is around 30 per cent.
The farmers are still being exploited by moneylenders who provide finance at exorbitant interest rates and there are cartels of traders who pay very little for their produce even in the well recognized mandies in the country.
Gross Capital Formation in Agriculture 
Though the overall growth of Indian economy has depended much upon the performance of agriculture, over the years, not much public investment has been made on its development.
There is a steady deceleration in public investment in gross capital formation in agriculture.
In 1980-81, the public investment as a percentage of gross capital formation in agriculture was 38.7 percent which fell to 16.2% in 1996-97.
During this period the share of private investment, however, rose from 61.3% to 83.8%.
This rise is attributed mostly to better terms of trade offered by the government to agriculture vis-a-vis industry.
The fall in public sector investment is attributed to increase in current expenditure to meet higher subsidies on food, fertilizers, electricity, irrigation, credit and other farm inputs rather than creating assets.
In recent years public expenditure on maintenance of existing irrigation projects has gone up and investment on new projects has fallen.
Many of the projects started in early 1980's are still awaiting completion because of cost overruns and non-availabilty of necessary timely funds.
In the 8th plan it was proposed to raise the investment in agriculture to 18.7% of the total plan outlay, but the actual investment turned out to be about 10-11% only.
Growth in Foodgrain Production
The foodgrain production in the 1950s rose in India because of expansion in area.
In the 1960s, the growth rate was very poor which resulted in large scale imports.
The development, production and use of better seeds increased the productivity of wheat in 1970s and rice in 1980s.
The eighties was also a period of green revolution which enabled India to become self-sufficient in foodgrain production and even a marginal exporter.
In the Nineties, however, the annual growth rate in production has fallen to 1.66 per cent from 3.54 per cent recorded in the eighties. 
This is a matter of serious concern for the country as this growth rate is just matching the annual growth rate of population and 40 percent of the population in the country is still living below the poverty line.
The production of foodgrains in the country fell to 192.4 million tonnes in 1997-98 from 199.4 million tonnes in 1996-97. 
The production of wheat dropped by 3.5 million tonnes and coarse cereals by 3 million tonnes.
The kharif 1998-99 crop was also no better.
However, the 1998-99 Rabi crop is expected to be good with a 5.2 million tonnes higher foodgrain output expected from it.
The crop is estimated at 96.5 million tonnes.
Agricultural ministry has projected a 1998-99 ouput of foodgrains at more than 200 million tonnes.
The union government had plans to cover about 2 million farmers in the country with a total credit of Rs. 168 crores in 1999 with'kisan cards'.
It has fixed interest rates on credit given to farmers through these cards at 13.26 per cent including tax on interest on the first Rs. 2 lakhs credit and , at 6.02 percent on amounts above Rs. 2.00 lakhs.

Agricultural Marketing
At present, most of the agricultural produce in the country is freely marketed through private trade operating in organized markets and mandies
Except for commodities like petroleum and coal and nitrogenous fertilizers and others whose prices are administered most agricultural commodity markets operate under the normal forces of demand and supply
In order to save the farmers from cartels of traders and encourage farmers to undertake the cultivation of certain specific crops like foodgrains and oilseeds and cotton and jute and tobacco and sugarcane and others the government also fixes minimum support and statutory prices for some crops and makes arrangements for their purchase on state account whenever their price fall below the support level
The role of the government normally is limited to protecting the interests of producers and consumers, only in respect of wage goods, mass consumption goods and essential goods
The government is promoting organized marketing of agricultural commodities in the country
To achieve this, the governments of many states and union territories have enacted necessary legislation for regulation of agricultural produce markets
The number of regulated markets in the country went up from 6,640 in 1990-91 to 6,968 in 1995-96 and 7,062 in 1996-97
The union government has also set up a number of organizations, under the aegis of ministry of agriculture and ministry of commerce, such as commodity boards, cooperative federations and export promotion councils for monitoring and boosting the production, consumption, marketing and export of various agricultural commodities
These include the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for recommending minimum prices of certain commodities; the Food Corporation of India Ltd. (FCI), the Cotton Corporation of India Ltd. (CCI), the Jute Corporation of India Ltd. (JCI), the National Cooperative Development Corporation Ltd. (NCDC), the National Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd. (NAFED), the National Tobacco Growers Federation Ltd. (NTGF), the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation Ltd. (TRIFED), the National Consumers Cooperative Federation Ltd. (NCCF), etc for procurement and distribution of commodities; and the Tea Board, Coffee Board, Coir Board, Rubber Board, Tobacco Board, Spices Board, Coconut Board, Central Silk Board, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), State Trading Corporation (STC), Agricultural & Processed Foods Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), the Indian Silk Export Promotion Council, the Cashewnuts Export Promotion Council of India (CEPC), etc for promotion of production and exports of specific commodities
The National Cooperative Union of India is an apex institution for cooperative Movement covering all types of cooperatives
It promotes and develops cooperatives by assisting groups of people in forming cooperatives
It also imparts cooperative education and organizes training programmes for managers and executives of cooperatives
NAFED is an apex cooperative marketing organization involved in procurement, distribution, export and import of select agricultural commodities
It is a central nodal agency of the government for undertaking price support operations for nonperishable commodities like pulses and oilseeds and for market intervention operations for perishable commodities like potatoes, onions, grapes, kinno, oranges, apples, eggs, chillies, black pepper, etc
During January 1997 to February 1998, NAFED undertook market intervention in 13 commodities
Most of the states in the country have set up Agricultural Produce Marketing Boards and Civil Supplies Corporations to deal with marketing and distribution of various commodities which are produced or sold in specific regions in the country
The union government provides financial and technical assistance to states in creation of infrastructural facilities in the markets including setting up of godowns in rural areas
Till the end of March 1997, grading standards have been prepared for 162 agricultural and allied commodities under the Agriculture Produce Act, 1937
In the Ninth Plan period, the Tamil Nadu government is expected to spend Rs. 100 crores on extension of agricultural marketing facilities in the state

The state government has prepared a master plan for the integrated development of 1,930 markets including 405 rural markets in the state
It is proposed to obtain 50 percent of the funds from the union government at 12 percent interest repayable in 14 years after a moratorium of two years for funding the development of 723 regulated markets
25 percent will be provided by the state government and 25 percent will be provided by the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee
The Kerala government has undertaken a Rs 72 crore EU-assisted project to set up 6 wholesale markets specifically for marketing of Fruits and Vegetables agricultural produce
Of these 3 will be in urban areas and of these 3 will be in rural areas
In India more than 100 million tonnes of fruits and vegetable are produced and marketed through a number of rural markets
The urban areas identified include Anayara in Thiruvananthapuram, Muvattapuzha in Ernakulam and S Batheri in Wayanad
In recent years, the monopoly of Kerala is being lost in the case of number of crops like coconut, rubber, pepper, ginger, cardamom, cashewnut because of new p options coming up in various states with high yielding pi materials
At present 60 percent of the net sown area in Kerala is under rubber and coconut
The fall in their prices in 1998 affected the lives of nearly two-third of its agricultural workforce

Marketing of Fruit and Vegetables
In India more than 100 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables are produced and marketed through a number of rural,wholesale and terminal markets every year.
The market reforms in agricultural commodities have so far been limited mainly to foodgrains only.
The marketing of fruits and vegetables has so far received little attention of the government.
At present, there are a large number of intermediaries in this trade between the producer and consumer which has resulted in a wide gap in the producer and consumer price of these commodities which needs to be reduced to enable farmers receive remunerative prices for their produce and boost their production and consumption in the country.
The union government has not made any common regulation for the marketing of fruits and vegetables applicable all over the country, however, some of the state governments have enacted laws and Acts.
The marketing of fruits and vegetables is under regulation in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka and outside any regulatory purview in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Jammu & Kashmir.
At present, the wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables on a country-wide basis are concentrated in 10 large cities viz Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Jaipur, Nagpur Vijayawada, Lucknow and Varanasi.
These cities account for the arrival of 75 percent of vegetables marketed in major urban areas in India.
Alone, Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Pune account for the arrival of 55 percent of vegetables.
Delhi and Calcutta account for transit trade in 40 percent fruits and 13 percent vegetables.
Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai receive 59 percent of total fruits and 46 percent of vegetables.
In a study carried out in 1998, it was found that cities with more than 20 lakh population account for transit trade in 66 percent of fruits and vegetables.
As per 1981 census, population exceeds 5 lakhs in 48 cities.
In those cities, there were 102 fruit and vegetable markets of which 54 were regulated.
The wholesale trade in fruits takes place in 65 markets and in vegetables in 81 markets.
Each market on an average serves a population of about 7 lakhs.
The prices in these markets are however governed by demand and supply principles while market committee does not play any role in correction or arresting wide price fluctuations.
Futures Trading
In continuation of the process of economic reforms, resumption of Futures Trading is receiving a renewed focus in the country.
The Kabra Committee, in its 1994 report, had recommended the allowing of futures trading in 17 commodities including kapas; raw jute and jute goods; seed, oil and oilcakes of groundnut, rapeseed/mustard, cottonseed, sesame, sunflower, copra and soyabean; ricebran oil; linseed; onions; and silver.
Futures trading in gur, potato, raw jute, turmeric, pepper and castorseed has been going on since long in the country.
More recently the union government has allowed futures trading in coffee, castor oil, jute sacking and cotton and has also permitted futures trading in palmolein, oilseeds and oilmeals subject to completion of certain formalities.
The futures trading in cotton was resumed after a gap of about 32 years at the Cotton Exchange Building in Mumbai on December 6, 1998.
An international futures exchange in pepper has started operating in the country and for castor was expected to begin in May 1999 in Navi Mumbai.

Soil for the cultivation of cabbage and cauliflower
What kind of soil is required for the cultivation of cabbage and cauliflower?
For the cultivation of cabbage and cauliflower, the soil should be medium black and should drain well.
The varieties of cabbage: Pride of India, early drumhead, Golden acre.
The varieties of cauliflower: Snowball 6, purata synthetics*.
The period for cultivation: September-October
Fertilisers and additional fertilisers: Use 40 to 50 carts of farm yard manure + 80 Kg nitrogen + 80 Kg phosphorus + 80 Kg potassium per hectare. 
Use 80 Kg of nitrogen 50 days after the cultivation.
Use 1 to 1.5 Kg weedicide called fluchloralin before sowing.
Chemical medicines: Use Neemark 5% fresh extract at an interval of 8 days.

Cold Storages
The number of cold storages (of more than 10 tonnes) in the country has gone up from 2,930 at the end of 1990-91 to 3,253 at the end of 1995-96 and their capacities have gone up from 7.68 million tonnes to 8.73 million tonnes.
The cold storages are being mostly used for the storage of agricultural commodities with potato being the largest stored commodity.
At present setting up of cold storages in India is not a lucrative activity because of high investment and low rental charges prevailing in the country.
In some of the states there are curbs on rental charges as they are fixed by the governments.
The NCDC provides financial assistance for setting up cold storages in the cooperative sector.
Till the end of March 1996, the NCDC had provided a total assistance of Rs. 79.97 crores for setting up of 248 cold storages with an installed capacity of 7.39 lakh tonnes.
In 1997, the union government repealed the Cold Storage Order, 1980.
Now no licence is required for setting up a cold storage as far as the union government is concerned.
This also means that no data will be available now on the total number of cold storages and their installed capacity in the country in the coming years.
According to a report prepared by an expert committee under the chairmanship of Mr. J.L.N. Srivastava, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, the present installed capacity, which needs to be raised to 123 lakh tonnes with an investment of Rs. 650 crores in the next 5 years, of cold storages in the country for the storage of potatoes is 103 lakh tonnes.
This can be done by setting up an additional capacity of 12 lakh tonnes and revamping a capacity of 8 lakh tonnes by rehabilitating some of the closed and sick cold storages.
The commitee had suggested setting up of 90 per cent of this additional capacity in the private sector and of this additional capacity 10 per cent in the cooperative/ private sector.
The committee has estimated the present installed capacity, which needs to be raised by 4.6 lakh tonnes in the coming 5 years, of the cold storage plants for onions at 4.5 lakh tonnes.
The committee has also suggested that the lending institutions should provide finance to cold storage plants at a concessional rate of 6 per cent, the excise duty on refrigeration plants and sandwich panels used for insulation be abolished.
The committee has recommended the replacement of present diffuser cooling system in cold storage plants by gravity/fin cooler system which saves power consumption by 20-25 per cent.
Accepting some of the recommendations of the committee, in the 1998-99 Budget, a credit-linked capital subsidy scheme for the construction of cold storages to be implemented by the ministry of agriculture with NABARD has been proposed.
There is a plan to create an additional cold storage capacity of 12 lakh tonnes and modernization/upgradation of existing 8 lakh tonnes capacity.
An additional capacity of 4.5 lakh tonnes for the storage of onions is also proposed to be created.
Insurance
In order to provide financial support to farmers in the event of crop failure due to drought, flood, etc and to restore the credit eligibility for the next crop season, a Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS), which covered wheat, paddy, millets, oilseeds and pulses, was introduced in April 1985.
Under the scheme, half of the premium payable by small and marginal farmers is subsidised equally by the central and the state governments and indemnity claims are shared by the union government and state governments in the ratio of 2:1.
The premium is charged at the rate of 2 per cent for rice, wheat and millet and 1 per cent for pulses and oilseeds.
The participation in the scheme is voluntary and the states are free to opt or not to opt for the scheme.
The scheme covers only those farmers who avail crop loans from cooperative credit institutions, commercial banks and regional rural banks for producing rice, wheat, millets, oilseeds and pulses.
The sum assured equals to the crop loan disbursed subject to a maximum of Rs. 10,000 per farmer.
The scheme also covers indemnity towards loss in yield.
If the actual average yield in any area covered by this scheme fails short of the guaranteed yield, the farmer is entitled to an indemnity to the extent of shortfall in yield viz-a-viz the guaranteed yield.
The scheme is being administered by the General Insurance Corporation of India.
Since the inception of the scheme in 1985 to Rabi 1996-97 season about 5.82 crore farmers were covered under the scheme and claims of Rs. 1,523 crore were paid against premium collections of mere Rs. 269 crore.
Till the end of Rabi 1997-98 season the scheme covered 6.45 crore farmers and claims of Rs. 1,623 crore were paid against a premium collection of only Rs. 313 crores.
The scheme has proved its unviability and the ministry of Agriculture has been working quite some time on some alternate models for agriculture.
In 1998, the union government , formulated a ' Modified Crop Insurance Scheme (MCCIS)' which received an in-principle clearance for introduction from Kharif 1999 by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in November 1998.
In 1997, an 'Experimental Crop Insurance Scheme (ECIS)' , which was to cover besides loanee farmers, non-loanee small and marginal farmers also, was formulated for implementation in 24 districts for rabi 1997-98 crop.
However, the scheme could be implemented in only 14 districts in 5 States and covered only non-loanee farmers.
All the premium payable was subsidized by the central and the state governments in the ratio of 4:1 and the risks and indemnities were also shared by them in 4:1 ratio.
About 4.78 lakh farmers were covered for a sum insured of Rs. 172 crores.
This scheme also proved a failure as the premium collected was only 2.86 crores and claims paid amounted to Rs. 39.78 crores.
From kharif 1998-99, this scheme has been discontinued.
In the interim, the CCIS has replaced the ECIS in those districts where the latter is discontinued.
The CCIS is being implemented, at present, in 16 states and union territories.
Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have not opted it.
The CCIS does not cover commercial crops like sugarcane, cotton, onions, potato, etc. 
The MCCIS, whose modalities are still being worked out may cover these crops also.
There is a proposal to set up a corporation to be called 'Agricultural Insurance Corporation of India' ' as a subsidiary of the General Insurance Corporation to manage its operations.
Under the MMCCIS, the farmers may have to pay premium as against the earlier schemes in which even the premium was being paid by the government.
For marginal farmers there will be concessions in premium charges.
The minimum support price will take care of the premium charges borne by farmers.
To start with the MMCCIS will be introduced in select districts and the MMCCIS will cover only foodgrains.
Later on it will be extended to all crops including oilseeds, horticulture, etc and all sorts of agricultural activities like fisheries, animal husbandry, sericulture, and so on. 
The scheme will be compulsory for farmers who avail loans from any government institution and optional for others.
Since past few years, the union government is also implementing a Livestock Insurance scheme, under which an animal is insured for its present market value or market value at the time of death whichever is lower.
In 1997-98, about 16.5 million animals were insured under this scheme.
A sum of Rs. 137.40 crore was received as premium and claims of Rs. 93.32 crore were disbursed by GIC which is implementing this scheme.

Question: Can gobar gas be generated again from the gobar gas slurry? Answer: Gobar gas can be generated from the slurry that comes out from the gobar gas plant. This slurry should be mixed with dung in the proportion of 25 to 50 per cent of the dung and then water should be added to it in a proper proportion. This mixture should contain water and solid matter in the proportion 1:1. The mixture should be passed in the gobar gas plant. If the slurry is passed in excess in the gobar gas plant, the acidity increases and the gobar gas may generate in lesser quantity.

Phanerogamic parasites on mango tree 
The mango trees have become 24 - 25 years old and their branches have been affected by phanerogamic parasites.
Due to this,their ability to bear fruit has become very low.
As almost all the branches have been affected by the phanerogamic parasites it is not practical to cut them.
So please suggest a remedy to maintain their proper growth and to enable them bear as many fruits as possible.
To let the phanerogamic parasites to grow would not prove beneficial for the plant, hence they should be cut every now and then so that they do not grow.
A tree with the phanerogamic parasite on it, will not give a satisfactory yield even if large quantities of fertilizers are used.
